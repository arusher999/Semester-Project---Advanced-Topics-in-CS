# Semester-Project---Advanced-Topics-in-CS
A groovy VR thing. Will be made in Unity and then the code will be exported to GitHub. Still needs to be started in Unity. The idea is to create a VR game, probably some sort of first person shooter themed game, in Unity editor and then export the game to the Quest to play it.

Objective: Learn how to use Unity properly, learn how to utilize physics engine and create a VR program/game. The idea will be to connect Virtual Reality with one of the global goals. Success will look like a fully functioning VR game/experience that allows the user to interact and learn from the environment.

Functionalities: will be a VR game / experience that is aimed to immerse and educate the player about a global goal.

Requirements: Updated unity, a pc, a VR headset.

Timeline: We will follow tutorials and guides as time permits. We will not spend much time outside of following these guides so our timeline is dependent on our ability to execute them. Below is a list of the checkpoints for progress.

VISION: we envision a interactive game that will immerse the player into a polluted world / environment and is set to help it out. For example, you load into the world and a distressed animal explains that their habitat is being destroyed by pollution. The player would then go around the map we created picking up and throwing out trash. We will implement more game like mechanics to make this more enjoyable and immersive as well. for example, a timer that increases when trash in thrown away (if timer runs out before all trash is thrown away you lose).

## Mentorship Connection Questions ##

What are your specific project goals?
- We want to create some sort of environmental cleanup game using the Meta Quest Pro and Unity.
  
What kind of project are you working on (software, hardware, VR/AR)?
- Using VR.

What technologies or tools are you using or learning?
- We are learning how to code in Unity and how to greate a full VR environment, as well as writing scripts alongside the game.
  
Which programming languages, frameworks, or hardware platforms do you need support with?
- We don't really need any support currently but we're using Unity on PC and coding using C++ to build scripts.
  
What challenges have you encountered?
- We have gotten stuck a couple of times with hand movement and environmental rendering.
  
Are you facing technical challenges, design issues, or project management difficulties?
- None currently.
  
What type of mentorship would be most helpful?
- Someone who knows a thing or two about VR game coding and creation, as well as Unity's software.
  
Do you want advice on technical skills, career guidance, or project management?
-Project possibly.

Have you considered your post-high school plans?
-Yes.

Are you looking for a mentor who can help with future internships, college applications, or career choices?
No.
