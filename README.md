# Semester-Project---Advanced-Topics-in-CS
A groovy VR thing. Will be made in Unity and then the code will be exported to GitHub. Still needs to be started in Unity. The idea is to create a VR game, probably some sort of first person shooter themed game, in Unity editor and then export the game to the Quest to play it.

Objective: Learn how to use Unity properly, learn how to utilize physics engine and create a VR program/game. The idea will be to connect Virtual Reality with one of the global goals. Success will look like a fully functioning VR game/experience that allows the user to interact and learn from the environment.

Functionalities: will be a VR game / experience that is aimed to immerse and educate the player about a global goal.

Requirements: Updated unity, a pc, a VR headset.

Timeline: We will follow tutorials and guides as time permits. We will not spend much time outside of following these guides so our timeline is dependent on our ability to execute them. Below is a list of the checkpoints for progress.

Research: We already know the tutorial we want to follow. It includes, movement, physics, UI, scenery, etc...



CURRENT PROGRESS (all research activities, including sources, findings, and decisions made throughout the project.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8/22/24 - Today we began our project and configured the Unity Hub codespace and updated some drivers in the Meta Quest app. We will next begin the actual coding of the project through Unity.

8/23/24 - Today we successfully connected the VR headset to Unity, linked hand models to the controllers, and gave the hand models animations.

8/26/24 - Today we began work on Part 02 and successully rendered a basic environment, and work on part 05 was also started with movement on the left joystick working successfully. We still              need to work on both but progress is continuing to be made.

8/27/24 - Today we focused on teleportation and movement work, and got teleportation with ray hands working successfully. Not quite done yet, but still making more progress. 

8/28/24 - Today we worked on grabbing mechanics, and got further in our progress with locomotion via teleportation

8/29/24 - Today we successfully got grab working! the physics of throwing and objects are still in progress.
