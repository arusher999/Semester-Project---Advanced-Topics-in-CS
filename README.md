# Semester-Project---Advanced-Topics-in-CS
A groovy VR thing. Will be made in Unity and then the code will be exported to GitHub. Still needs to be started in Unity. The idea is to create a VR game, probably some sort of first person shooter themed game, in Unity editor and then export the game to the Quest to play it.

Objective: Learn how to use Unity properly, learn how to utilize physics engine and create a VR program/game. The idea will be to connect Virtual Reality with one of the global goals. Success will look like a fully functioning VR game/experience that allows the user to interact and learn from the environment.

Functionalities: will be a VR game / experience that is aimed to immerse and educate the player about a global goal.

Requirements: Updated unity, a pc, a VR headset.

Timeline: We will follow tutorials and guides as time permits. We will not spend much time outside of following these guides so our timeline is dependent on our ability to execute them.

Research: We already know the tutorial we want to follow. It includes, movement, physics, UI, scenery, etc...

CURRENT PROGRESS (all research activities, including sources, findings, and decisions made throughout the project.)
