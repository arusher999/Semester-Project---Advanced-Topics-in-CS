# Semester-Project---Advanced-Topics-in-CS
A groovy VR thing. Will be made in Unity and then the code will be exported to GitHub. Still needs to be started in Unity. The idea is to create a VR game, probably some sort of first person shooter themed game, in Unity editor and then export the game to the Quest to play it.

Objective: Learn how to use Unity properly, learn how to utilize physics engine and create a VR program/game. The idea will be to connect Virtual Reality with one of the global goals. Success will look like a fully functioning VR game/experience that allows the user to interact and learn from the environment.

Functionalities: will be a VR game / experience that is aimed to immerse and educate the player about a global goal.

Requirements: Updated unity, a pc, a VR headset.

Timeline: We will follow tutorials and guides as time permits. We will not spend much time outside of following these guides so our timeline is dependent on our ability to execute them. Below is a list of the checkpoints for progress.

VISION: we envision a interactive game that will immerse the player into a polluted world / environment and is set to help it out. For example, you load into the world and a distressed animal explains that their habitat is being destroyed by pollution. The player would then go around the map we created picking up and throwing out trash. We will implement more game like mechanics to make this more enjoyable and immersive as well. for example, a timer that increases when trash in thrown away (if timer runs out before all trash is thrown away you lose).

## Mentorship Connection Questions ##

What are your specific project goals?
- We want to create some sort of environmental cleanup game using the Meta Quest Pro and Unity.
  
What kind of project are you working on (software, hardware, VR/AR)?
- Using VR.

What technologies or tools are you using or learning?
- We are learning how to code in Unity and how to greate a full VR environment, as well as writing scripts alongside the game.
  
Which programming languages, frameworks, or hardware platforms do you need support with?
- We don't really need any support currently but we're using Unity on PC and coding using C++ to build scripts.
  
What challenges have you encountered?
- We have gotten stuck a couple of times with hand movement and environmental rendering.
  
Are you facing technical challenges, design issues, or project management difficulties?
- None currently.
  
What type of mentorship would be most helpful?
- Someone who knows a thing or two about VR game coding and creation, as well as Unity's software.
  
Do you want advice on technical skills, career guidance, or project management?
-Project possibly.

Have you considered your post-high school plans?
-Yes.

Are you looking for a mentor who can help with future internships, college applications, or career choices?
No.

Research: We already know the tutorial we want to follow. It includes, movement, physics, UI, scenery, etc...



CURRENT PROGRESS (all research activities, including sources, findings, and decisions made throughout the project.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8/22/24 - Today we began our project and configured the Unity Hub codespace and updated some drivers in the Meta Quest app. We will next begin the actual coding of the project through Unity.

8/23/24 - Today we successfully connected the VR headset to Unity, linked hand models to the controllers, and gave the hand models animations.

8/26/24 - Today we began work on Part 02 and successully rendered a basic environment, and work on part 05 was also started with movement on the left joystick working successfully. We still              need to work on both but progress is continuing to be made.

8/27/24 - Today we focused on teleportation and movement work, and got teleportation with ray hands working successfully. Not quite done yet, but still making more progress. 

8/28/24 - Today we worked on grabbing mechanics, and got further in our progress with locomotion via teleportation

8/29/24 - Today we successfully got grab working! the physics of throwing and objects are still in progress.

8/30/24 - today we had some troubles getting everthing started so we didn't have as much time to work on things. We managed to make a garbage can and trash for the game.

9/2/2024 - today we finished trash can functionality, now working on making the hand invisible when it grabs an object.

9/3/2024 - today we finished grab functionality by making the hands turn invisible when holding objects for further immersiveness - video 3 complete. Began detailing the environment as well.

9/5/2024 - worked on the environment but had a couple hitches with the texture rendering, environment needs more work.

9/6/2024 - Completed and got over the environment hitch - looks quite pretty now. Will continue work on environment and also move on to interactables within the environment soon.

9/9/2024 - removed trees from mountains (looks more natural this way) started working on snap grab and use.

9/10/2024 - Finished and polished teleportation and snap grab and use.

9/11/2024 - Completed some project research through beatsaber. Highly intense research was completed.

9/12/2024 - Worked on improving the environment's terrain to make it more realistic, and removed some of the more mountainous areas.

9/13/2024 - Worked on road creation in the environment - looking to eventually create a town/city.

9/16/2024 - Finished creating the roads, now working on bulding placement and making the town look alive.

9/17/2024 - Continues working on building placement and town design.
